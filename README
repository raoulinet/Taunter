Taunter - README


= Installation =

First of all, you need few libraries. I used to matplotlib and enthought because both are dealing with efficient features, simple interfaces and  more or less a good documentation.

== Linux ==

Just do:
sudo aptitude install ipython python-matplotlib enthought-traits


== Windows, Linux and MacOSX ==

Take a look at:

http://www.pythonxy.com/


== Unzipping and copying around ==

It does not matter you download the zip or tar file, just uncompress it in a folder.
I did it in the ~/Taunter file.
Actually, Taunter is the name of my project.
Google 'french taunter' to get more informationsi.
Anyway, open a terminal and do:

    $ mkdir ~/Taunter
    $ mv ~/Downloads/raoulinet-Taunter-904d824.tar.gz ~/Taunter
    $ tar -xzf raoulinet-Taunter-904d824.tar.gz

So now there are two stuff to do.
Import the usefull modules at the loading of ipython.
To do so, just go in ~/.ipython folder and set the ipythonrc file.

    $ cd ~/.ipython
    $ vi ipythonrc

Now you have entered in the marvellous world of Vim, so check for 'execfile' word by typing

    :/execfile

It should point on this:

    execfile

So you just have to add the path + name of the files you want to import at the laoding.
Do it by typing i (only i) to go in insertion mode and type this:

    execfile ~/Taunter/graphconf.py ~/Taunter/tools.py

Ok now save and close.
Come back in command mode by pressing ESC key on youre keybord.

    :w
    :q

Now you are out of vim.
I mean, I hope you're out of it.
Then the last stuff to do.

    $ mv ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc_BAK 
    $ cp ~/Taunter/matplotlibrc ~/.matplotlib/

Restart python and check with 

    plot(rand(10), rand(10))
    xlabel("$x$label")
    ylabel("ylabel")
    title("Title")
    setp(cx().label, 'color', 'r') # the most awesomest feature of matplotlib
    get_index_list()

If it works, great.
If it doesn't, sorry.
